## Avoid jargon

- Explain the jargon in plain terms, maybe use compare the term to something more familiar to the audience. Analogies
    - e.g. When takling to millenials, you can say something is old by saying it's as old as iPhone 4 (the speaker didn't say this, I did)

{{< figure src="noknows.png" title="It's okay to not know the answer!" align="left">}}

- Don't assume prior knowledge
- Ask questions at the start to gauge prior knowledge


## General presentation tips
- Brief dot points - refer back to them
- If someone ask a question and you don't understand, ask them to clarify or repeat the question. 
- Less formal tone

Ideas for gathering feedback and judging engagement

- Pay attention to audience body language and facial expressions
- Ask audience to fill feedback. Let audience self-identify how engaged they were
- Reflect on the questions that were asked during the questions. 

## Public outreach

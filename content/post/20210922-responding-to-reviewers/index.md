Notes from TE&E How to respond to reviewer?
2021-09-22

## Be polite
“This should be review by native English speaker!”

•	Be careful.
•	Don’t react to rudeness with rudeness.

Pet peeves:
•	Carelessness in response letters
•	Figure cross reference wrong (eg. Figure 5 doesn’t refer to Figure 5!)

Tips for responding:
•	Make it easiest for the reviewers and editors as possible to see that you have done to address the comments. (E.g. use both line numbers and quote)
•	Read the comments and put them away for a day before responding!
•	Respond to the easy ones first.

Defending your statements:
•	Give your argument why you think it’s worth doing.
•	“Beyond the scope of this paper” if reviewer ask you to do something that is beyond. 
•	You can carry out the analysis and show it to your reviewer. You may also say this doesn’t add to the paper. 

As a reviewer, what makes you reject the paper?
•	Methods and results don’t support the conclusion
•	Fit for the journal?

Fun poll at the beginning of our TE&amp;amp;E Time today Our topic of discussion today is &amp;ldquo;How to get rich slowly: a bunch of things about money I wish someone had told me when I was a grad student.&amp;rdquo; Led by Rob Lanfear
These are the notes I took quickly as the discussion went along, they might not be super accurate and detailed!</description></item></channel></rss>

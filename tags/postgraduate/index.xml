Fun poll at the beginning of our TE&amp;amp;E Time today Our topic of discussion today is &amp;ldquo;How to get rich slowly: a bunch of things about money I wish someone had told me when I was a grad student.&amp;rdquo; Led by Rob Lanfear
These are the notes I took quickly as the discussion went along, they might not be super accurate and detailed!</description></item><item><title>Responding to Reviewers</title><link>https://rsbteetime.github.io/post/20210922-responding-to-reviewers/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://rsbteetime.github.io/post/20210922-responding-to-reviewers/</guid><description>Notes from TE&amp;amp;E How to respond to reviewer? 2021-09-22
Be polite “This should be review by native English speaker!”
• Be careful. • Don’t react to rudeness with rudeness.
Pet peeves: • Carelessness in response letters • Figure cross reference wrong (eg. Figure 5 doesn’t refer to Figure 5!)
Tips for responding: • Make it easiest for the reviewers and editors as possible to see that you have done to address the comments.</description></item></channel></rss>
